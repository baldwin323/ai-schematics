1. HTML and CSS: The "index.html" file will contain the structure of the website, and the "styles.css" file will contain the custom styles. Both files will share class names and id names for styling and structuring the website.

2. Tailwind CSS: The "tailwind.css" file will contain the Tailwind CSS framework styles. This file will be linked in the "index.html" file and will share class names with both "index.html" and "styles.css".

3. DOM Elements: The "index.html" file will contain various DOM elements like div, span, header, footer, etc. The id names of these elements will be shared with "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" for styling purposes.

4. CSS Classes: The CSS classes defined in "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" will be used in "index.html" to apply styles to the HTML elements. These class names are shared dependencies.

5. Link and Script Tags: The "index.html" file will have link tags to include the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. These are shared dependencies as they connect the HTML file with the CSS files.

6. Media Queries: If the website is responsive, then the media queries defined in "styles.css" will be shared with the HTML elements in "index.html".

Note: As there is no mention of JavaScript or any backend language, there are no shared dependencies related to exported variables, data schemas, message names, or function names.
